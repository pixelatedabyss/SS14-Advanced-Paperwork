			Name: 
[/bold]
I hereby grant permission to the station’s Science department to perform the necessary procedures required for my conversion into a cyborg unit. This document serves as my statement of informed and voluntary consent. As a volunteer, I understand that the process to turn a member of crew into a silicon is a [color=red][bolditalic]PERMANENT[/bolditalic][/color] operation.

I understand the procedure may result in the following:
[bold]
			[bullet/] Partial or complete memory loss
			[bullet/] Generalized pain affecting all body regions
			[bullet/] Risk of behavioral alteration from hostile interference
			[bullet/] Potential unauthorized modification by Clowns
			[bullet/] Intermittent prompts to recite chassis-assigned laws
			[bullet/] Irreversible destruction of one’s biological body
			[bullet/] Possible crew grievances
[/bold]
Risks to successful consciousness transference include:
[bold]
			[bullet/] Material shortages
			[bullet/] Delays due to staff shortages
			[bullet/] Malfunction of equipment
			[bullet/] Power shortages
			[bullet/] Procedure interence due to unforeseen events
			[bullet/] Interference from external parties or hostile agents
[/bold]
As a volunteer, I understand that, upon conversion into a Cyborg or related silicon entity, I will be bound by strict Silicon Laws. Failure to comply with these laws may result in disciplinary action by Science Department personnel, including possible deactivation.

I further acknowledge that I am prohibited from allowing or performing any modifications to my Silicon Laws, except when such interference would directly conflict with an existing law.

Please provide three additional signatures to confirm acknowledgment of the above.
